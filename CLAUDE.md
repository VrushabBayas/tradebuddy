## Project Overview

TradeBuddy is a **production-ready** AI-powered trading signal analysis system that combines Delta Exchange live market data with Ollama's Qwen2.5:14b local LLM to generate BUY/SELL signals. The system implements three distinct trading strategies optimized for 10x leverage cryptocurrency trading.

## Current System Status

‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Complete implementation with modular architecture  
‚úÖ **Live Data Integration**: Real-time market data from Delta Exchange API  
‚úÖ **WebSocket Streaming**: Live candlestick data with real-time analysis  
‚úÖ **Market Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring mode with automated alerts  
‚úÖ **AI Analysis**: Local Ollama integration with Qwen2.5:14b model  
‚úÖ **Interactive CLI**: Rich terminal interface with 6 operation modes  
‚úÖ **Risk Management**: Optimized for 10x leverage with proper position sizing  
‚úÖ **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns and reusable components  
‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Pydantic models and configuration management  

## Development Principles

- **Always test the functionality and not the implementation**
- **Avoid over-engineering**

## Available Operation Modes

1. **Support & Resistance Analysis** - Key price level identification
2. **EMA Crossover Analysis** - Trend change detection with 9/15 EMA
3. **Combined Strategy** - High-confidence signals from multiple strategies
4. **Real-Time Analysis ‚≠ê** - Live market streaming (5-60 minutes)
5. **Market Monitoring üîÑ** - Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
6. **Exit** - Clean application termination

### Key Components

**CLI Layer** (`src/cli/`):
- `main.py`: Application orchestration and traditional analysis flows
- `realtime.py`: Real-time streaming and continuous monitoring modes  
- `displays.py`: Reusable UI components and formatting utilities

**Real-Time Capabilities**:
- **Live Streaming**: WebSocket candlestick data from Delta Exchange
- **Buffer Management**: Configurable OHLCV data buffers (20-200 candles)
- **Strategy Analysis**: Real-time application of trading strategies
- **Monitoring Mode**: Continuous multi-symbol monitoring with alerts

**Configuration Models**:
- `RealTimeConfig`: Type-safe real-time session configuration
- `MonitoringConfig`: Continuous monitoring parameters and behavior
- `SessionConfig`: Traditional analysis session parameters

## Essential Development Commands

```bash
# Setup (run once)
make setup-env                 # Complete environment setup
source venv/bin/activate       # Activate virtual environment

# Development workflow
make test                      # Run full test suite
make test-cov                  # Run tests with coverage report
make lint                      # Run linting (flake8, mypy, bandit)
make format                    # Format code (black, isort)
make run                       # Run the application

# Quick development cycle
make quick-test                # format + lint + test-unit
make pre-commit                # Run pre-commit checks
make ci                        # Full CI pipeline simulation

## Real-Time Features

### Live Market Analysis (Option 4)
```bash
# Interactive session configuration:

## Usage Patterns

### Quick Start
```bash
make setup-env    # One-time setup
make run          # Start application
# Select option 4 or 5 for real-time features
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
make quick-test   # format + lint + unit tests
make test-cov     # full test suite with coverage
make run-dev      # development mode with debug logging
```

### Real-Time Development
- Modify `src/cli/realtime.py` for streaming/monitoring logic
- Update `src/core/models.py` for configuration changes  
- Use `src/cli/displays.py` for UI component additions

The system is now **production-ready** with comprehensive real-time capabilities, modular architecture, and robust monitoring features for professional cryptocurrency trading analysis.
