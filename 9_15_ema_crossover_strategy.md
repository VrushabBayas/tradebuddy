# 9 EMA / 15 EMA Crossover Trading Strategy - Requirement Document

## 1. Objective

To build and deploy a systematic trading strategy based on the crossover of the 9-period and 15-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), applied on the BTC/USD 15-minute chart. The strategy integrates candlestick confirmation, optional technical filters (RSI, Volume, 50 EMA), and risk management rules to generate reliable entry and exit signals.

## 2. Entry & Exit Conditions

### 2.1 Long Entry

- 9 EMA crosses above 15 EMA.
- Candle closes above both 9 EMA and 15 EMA.
- Optional Filters (enabled):
  - RSI (14) > 50
  - Price above 50 EMA
  - Volume ≥ 110% of 20-period average
  - Bullish candlestick confirmation

### 2.2 Short Entry

- 9 EMA crosses below 15 EMA.
- Candle closes below both 9 EMA and 15 EMA.
- Optional Filters (enabled):
  - RSI (14) < 50
  - Price below 50 EMA
  - Volume ≥ 110% of 20-period average
  - Bearish candlestick confirmation

### 2.3 Exit Conditions

- Opposite EMA crossover occurs.
- Optional:
  - Trailing stop using ATR (1.5x ATR(14))
  - Fixed Stop-Loss: recent swing low/high beyond signal candle
  - Profit target: 2x risk or user-defined

---

## 3. Risk Management

- Risk per trade: 1–2% of capital
- Use ATR to dynamically size stop-loss
- Position size adjusted to maintain max allowable risk

---

## 4. Technical Indicators Used

- 9 EMA
- 15 EMA
- 50 EMA (trend filter)
- RSI (14)
- Volume (with 20-period SMA)
- ATR (14) for volatility-based exits

## 5. Pine Script Implementation

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("9/15 EMA Crossover BTCUSD 15m", overlay=true, pyramiding=1, default_qty_type=strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value=1)

fast = ta.ema(close, 9)
slow = ta.ema(close, 15)
ema50 = ta.ema(close, 50)
rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)
volAvg = ta.sma(volume,20)
atr = ta.atr(14)

longCondition = ta.crossover(fast, slow) and close > fast and close > slow and close > ema50 and rsi > 50 and volume > volAvg
shortCondition = ta.crossunder(fast, slow) and close < fast and close < slow and close < ema50 and rsi < 50 and volume > volAvg

if longCondition
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
if shortCondition
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)

strategy.exit("Exit Long","Long", stop = close - atr * 1.5, trail_points = atr * 1.5)
strategy.exit("Exit Short","Short", stop = close + atr * 1.5, trail_points = atr * 1.5)

plot(fast, color=color.blue)
plot(slow, color=color.orange)
plot(ema50, color=color.green)
```

## 7. Deployment Plan

### 7.1 Paper Trading Phase

- Implement strategy in TradingView using Pine Script.
- Simulate real-time trades on BTC/USD 15m chart.
- Log each trade: date/time, entry/exit, P&L, notes.
- Review monthly statistics: win rate, drawdown, expectancy.

### 7.2 Optimization

- Tweak filters: RSI thresholds, ATR multiplier.
- Test alternate R\:R settings (e.g., 1:1.5, 1:2).
- Evaluate impact of enabling/disabling volume filter or 50 EMA.

### 7.3 Go-Live Transition

- Start with small capital (1–2% risk per trade).
- Monitor for 2–4 weeks.
- Gradually increase capital upon consistent performance.
- Conduct monthly strategy reviews and re-optimization.

---

## 8. Notes & Considerations

- Avoid trading during high-impact news events.
- Strategy is best suited to trending markets.
- Should not be used standalone in highly choppy or sideways ranges.
- Consider integrating with alerts or bots for automation.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The 9 EMA / 15 EMA crossover strategy, when enhanced with proper filters and risk controls, provides a rule-based framework for capturing short-term trends in BTC/USD. With solid paper trading and backtesting, this system can be transitioned to live environments for consistent and disciplined execution.
