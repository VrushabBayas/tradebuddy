# 🔑 Delta Exchange API Keys Guide

## ✅ Current Status: NO API KEYS NEEDED!

**Good News**: TradeBuddy currently works **without any API keys** because it only uses public market data endpoints.

## 📊 What Works Without API Keys

✅ **Market Data (OHLCV candles)**
✅ **Current Prices (Ticker data)**
✅ **Symbol Information**
✅ **Public Order Book**
✅ **All TradeBuddy Features** (analysis, signals, strategies)

## 🔒 When You WOULD Need API Keys

API keys are only required for **actual trading operations**:

- 🔒 Placing buy/sell orders
- 🔒 Checking account balance
- 🔒 Viewing your positions
- 🔒 Order history
- 🔒 Wallet operations

## 🚀 How to Get API Keys (Optional)

If you want to extend TradeBuddy for actual trading in the future:

### 1. **Create Delta Exchange Account**
- Go to [Delta Exchange](https://www.delta.exchange/)
- Sign up and complete KYC verification

### 2. **Generate API Keys**
- Visit [API Key Management](https://www.delta.exchange/app/account/manageapikeys)
- Click "Create New API Key"
- Select permissions:
  - ✅ **Read Data** (for account info)
  - ✅ **Trading** (for placing orders) - only if you want auto-trading
- Set IP whitelisting for security
- Save your API Key and Secret safely

### 3. **Configure TradeBuddy**
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Delta Exchange API Keys (Optional)
DELTA_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DELTA_EXCHANGE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### **API Key Security**
- **Never share your API keys**
- **Use IP whitelisting** when possible
- **Separate keys for different purposes**
- **Regularly rotate your keys**
- **Start with read-only permissions**

### **Trading Permissions**
- **Start with "Read Data" only**
- **Add "Trading" permission only when ready for live trading**
- **Test with small amounts first**

## 📈 Rate Limits (No API Key)

Without API keys, public endpoints have these limits:
- **10,000 requests per 5-minute window**
- **500 operations per second**
- **Weight-based system** (different endpoints have different costs)

This is **more than enough** for TradeBuddy's current usage!

## 🔮 Future Trading Features

When we add actual trading capabilities, you'll need:

### **Paper Trading Mode**
- **No API keys needed**
- **Simulated trading with real market data**
- **Perfect for testing strategies**

### **Live Trading Mode**

2. ✅ **Full analysis capabilities**
3. ✅ **All three trading strategies**
4. ✅ **Real-time market data**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"API Connection Error"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Delta Exchange is accessible
- No API keys needed for current features

### **"Rate Limit Exceeded"**
- Wait 1 minute and retry
- Public endpoints have generous limits
- Consider using longer timeframes
