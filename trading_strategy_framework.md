# Simple Trading Signal Analysis - Three Strategy Approach

## Technology Stack
- **Data Source**: Delta Exchange Live API
- **AI Model**: Ollama Qwen2.5:14b (Local LLM)
- **Analysis Modes**: 3 distinct approaches for maximum flexibility

## Objective
Use **Ollama Qwen2.5:14b** to analyze **Delta Exchange live data** and generate **BUY/SELL signals** using three distinct approaches:
1. **Support and Resistance Strategy** (Standalone)
2. **9 EMA and 15 EMA Crossover Strategy** (Standalone)
3. **Combined Strategy** (Both strategies together)

---

## Strategy Definitions

### Strategy 1: Support and Resistance
**Concept**: Identify key price levels where price historically bounces (support) or gets rejected (resistance)

**Buy Signal Conditions**:
- Price approaches a strong support level
- Price shows signs of bouncing off support
- Volume increases at support level
- Previous support level has held multiple times

**Sell Signal Conditions**:
- Price approaches a strong resistance level
- Price shows signs of rejection at resistance
- Volume increases at resistance level
- Previous resistance level has rejected price multiple times

### Strategy 2: 9 EMA and 15 EMA Crossover
**Concept**: Use the crossover of two Exponential Moving Averages to identify trend changes

**Buy Signal Conditions**:
- 9 EMA crosses above 15 EMA (Golden Cross)
- Price is above both EMAs
- Both EMAs are trending upward
- Volume confirms the move

**Sell Signal Conditions**:
- 9 EMA crosses below 15 EMA (Death Cross)
- Price is below both EMAs
- Both EMAs are trending downward
- Volume confirms the move

## Signal Decision Logic

### Mode 1: Support/Resistance Strategy (Standalone)

**STRONG BUY**: Price at strong support with high bounce probability (confidence >8)
**BUY**: Price near support with good bounce setup (confidence 6-8)
**NEUTRAL**: Price in middle range, no clear S/R level nearby (confidence <6)
**SELL**: Price near resistance with rejection signs (confidence 6-8)
**STRONG SELL**: Price at strong resistance with high rejection probability (confidence >8)

### Mode 2: EMA Crossover Strategy (Standalone)

**STRONG BUY**: 9 EMA strongly above 15 EMA, both trending up, price above both (confidence >8)
**BUY**: Recent golden cross with upward momentum (confidence 6-8)
**NEUTRAL**: EMAs flat or conflicting signals (confidence <6)
**SELL**: Recent death cross with downward momentum (confidence 6-8)
**STRONG SELL**: 9 EMA strongly below 15 EMA, both trending down, price below both (confidence >8)

### Mode 3: Combined Strategy Rules

**STRONG BUY**: Both strategies signal BUY with confidence >7
**BUY**: One strategy signals BUY (confidence >7), other NEUTRAL (confidence >4)
**WAIT**: Conflicting signals (one BUY, one SELL) or both low confidence (<6)
**SELL**: One strategy signals SELL (confidence >7), other NEUTRAL (confidence >4)
**STRONG SELL**: Both strategies signal SELL with confidence >7

**Confluence Bonus**: When both strategies agree (same direction), add +1 to confidence score

### Risk Management (All Modes)
- **Entry**: Only enter when signal confidence >6
- **Position Size**: 
  - Mode 1 & 2: Confidence 6-7 = 2% portfolio, 8-10 = 3-4%
  - Mode 3: Same as above, but confluence signals can use up to 5%
- **Stop Loss**: Always set 2-3% below entry for longs, 2-3% above for shorts
- **Take Profit**: Target 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio minimum

**When to Use Mode 2 (EMA Only):**
- Trending markets with clear momentum
- When S/R levels are unclear or frequently broken
- Longer timeframes (4h, daily) for trend following
- Markets with smooth, sustained moves

**When to Use Mode 3 (Combined):**
- Uncertain market conditions requiring confirmation
- When both strategies show clear signals
- Higher timeframe analysis for major positions
- When maximum confidence is needed before entry
