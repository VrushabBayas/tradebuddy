## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (Python 3.11 recommended)
- **16GB+ RAM** (for optimal Ollama performance)
- **10GB+ free disk space** (for AI model)
- **Stable internet connection** (for Delta Exchange API)

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VrushabBayas/tradebuddy.git
cd tradebuddy

# Set up development environment (creates venv, installs deps, creates .env)
make setup-env

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Ollama Setup

```bash
# Install Ollama (visit https://ollama.ai/ for instructions)
# For macOS:
brew install ollama

# Download the required model (8.7GB)
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Verify installation
ollama run qwen2.5:14b "Hello, how are you?"
```

### 3. Run TradeBuddy

```bash
# Run the application
make run

# Or run directly
python tradebuddy.py
```

## 📊 Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Support & Resistance
- **Focus**: Identifies key price levels where price historically bounces or gets rejected
- **Confirmation**: Volume analysis at support/resistance zones
- **Best For**: Range-bound markets and precise entry timing
- **Signals**: BUY at support bounces, SELL at resistance rejections

### Strategy 2: EMA Crossover (9/15)
- **Focus**: Uses exponential moving average crossovers to identify trend changes
- **Signals**: Golden Cross (9 EMA > 15 EMA) = Buy, Death Cross (9 EMA < 15 EMA) = Sell
- **Best For**: Trending markets with clear momentum
- **Confirmation**: Volume and momentum validation

### Strategy 3: Combined Analysis
- **Focus**: Combines both strategies for maximum confidence
- **Logic**: Requires confluence between support/resistance and EMA signals
- **Result**: Higher accuracy but fewer signals
- **Best For**: Major position entries requiring high confidence

🤖 AI Analysis Results
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✨ Ollama AI Analysis

**TRADING SIGNAL:** NEUTRAL
**CONFIDENCE:** 4/10
**ENTRY PRICE:** N/A
**STOP LOSS:** N/A
**TAKE PROFIT:** N/A

**ANALYSIS:**
Based on the EMA crossover analysis and volume data provided, there is currently no clear buy or sell signal. The 9 EMA ($117,837.08) is below the 15 EMA ($117,863.53), indicating a bearish trend in the short term. However, the crossover strength is very weak at 2/10, suggesting that this signal may not be reliable enough to act upon.

Additionally, the price action analysis shows that BTCUSDT is trading sideways with a trend direction and strength of 5/10, indicating low momentum and volatility. The volume ratio of 2.42x suggests above-average trading activity compared to average volumes but does not indicate any significant directional movement.

**REASONING:**
1. **Weak EMA Crossover:** The current EMA crossover is weak (crossover strength at 2/10), which means the signal may be unreliable and could reverse direction quickly.

2. **Sideways Price Action:** The price action analysis indicates that BTCUSDT is trading in a sideways pattern with low momentum, making it difficult to predict short-term directional movement.

3. **Volume Analysis:** While volume has increased compared to average levels (volume ratio of 2.42x), this increase does not correlate with any significant price movement or trends, suggesting the current activity may be noise rather than a signal for a new trend.

Given these factors, it is prudent to wait for clearer signals before entering into a trade.

EMA CONTEXT:
EMA Values: 9-EMA $117,837.08, 15-EMA $117,863.53
Crossover: Death Cross
Crossover Strength: 2/10
EMA Separation: 0.02%
Trend Alignment: Strong Bearish
Volume Confirmed: Yes
Momentum Score: 5/10
Signal Quality: Poor
```

**Key Points:**
- **Conservative Approach**: System correctly identifies weak signals and recommends waiting
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Combines technical indicators with AI reasoning
- **Risk Management**: N/A values prevent risky trades on low-confidence signals
- **Detailed Context**: Provides complete technical analysis for decision making

## 🔧 Recent Refactoring (Production-Ready Improvements)

### Key Improvements Made

1. **🛠️ Shared Utilities System**
   - Created centralized `data_helpers.py` with safe data access functions
   - Added `type_conversion.py` for safe Decimal/float conversions
   - Eliminated code duplication across strategy files

2. **🎯 Type Safety Enhancements**
   - Fixed all Decimal/float mixing issues that caused runtime errors
   - Added safe type conversion utilities (`to_float()`, `to_decimal()`)
   - Standardized type handling across all financial calculations

3. **📋 Constants Centralization**
   - Added 23+ trading constants to eliminate magic numbers
   - Centralized all thresholds in `TradingConstants` class
   - Improved maintainability and consistency

4. **🧹 Code Quality Improvements**
   - Removed unused imports and fixed function shadowing
   - Standardized utility usage across all strategy files
   - Enhanced error handling with proper type validation

5. **🧪 Test Suite Enhancement**
   - Implemented functionality-focused testing approach
   - Achieved 90%+ test coverage (improved from 6%)
   - Added comprehensive edge case and error handling tests
   - Created end-to-end CLI workflow testing

### Before vs After

**Before Refactoring:**
```python
# Duplicate code in multiple files
def _get_value(self, obj, key, default=None):
    # Same function in 3 different files

# Magic numbers scattered throughout
if volume_ratio > 1.2:  # What does 1.2 mean?
    confidence += 2      # What does 2 represent?

# Type conversion errors
price_diff = current_price - level.level  # Decimal/float mixing
```

**After Refactoring:**
```python
# Shared utilities
from src.utils.data_helpers import get_value
from src.utils.type_conversion import to_float
from src.core.constants import TradingConstants

# Descriptive constants
if volume_ratio > TradingConstants.VOLUME_CONFIRMATION_THRESHOLD:
    confidence += TradingConstants.VOLUME_CONFIDENCE_BONUS

# Safe type conversions
price_diff = to_float(current_price) - to_float(get_value(level, 'level', 0))
```
