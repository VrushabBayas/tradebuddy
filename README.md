## 📊 Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Support & Resistance
- Identifies key price levels where price historically bounces or gets rejected
- Analyzes volume confirmation at support/resistance zones
- Best for: Range-bound markets and precise entry timing

### Strategy 2: EMA Crossover (9/15)
- Uses exponential moving average crossovers to identify trend changes
- Golden Cross (9 EMA > 15 EMA) = Buy signal
- Death Cross (9 EMA < 15 EMA) = Sell signal
- Best for: Trending markets with clear momentum

### Strategy 3: Combined Analysis
- Combines both strategies for maximum confidence
- Looks for confluence between support/resistance and EMA signals
- Higher accuracy but fewer signals
- Best for: Major position entries requiring high confidence

```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Run in development mode with debug output

```

### Environment Check

```bash
# Check Python installation
make check-python

# Verify system requirements and dependencies
make check-env
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### Python Command Not Found
If you get `python: command not found` when running `make setup-env`:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check which Python you have installed
which python3
which python

# If you have python3 but not python, our Makefile will auto-detect python3
# Just run setup again:
make setup-env
```

**Alternative manual setup:**
```bash
# Use python3 directly
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

#### Virtual Environment Creation Failed
If virtual environment creation fails:

**Check Python version:**
```bash
python3 --version
# Should be 3.9 or higher
```

**Install Python if needed:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install python

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

# Windows
# Download from https://python.org
```

#### Build Dependencies Missing (macOS)
If you see errors like "Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... error" or "pkg-config not found":

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Install build dependencies automatically
make fix-build-deps

# Then retry setup
make clean-all
make setup-env
```

**Manual Fix:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install build tools
brew install pkg-config

# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

#### Pandas/NumPy Installation Issues
If you see Meson build errors or compilation failures:

**Use our compatible requirements:**
```bash
# Our requirements use versions with pre-built wheels
make setup-env
```

**Alternative approach:**
```bash
# Install from conda-forge (if you have conda)
conda install -c conda-forge pandas numpy

# Or use pip with no-build-isolation
pip install --no-build-isolation pandas numpy
```

#### Permission Errors
If you get permission errors during setup:

```bash
# Don't use sudo! Instead, fix pip user installation:
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip

# Or use brew on macOS:
brew install python
```

### Environment Diagnostics

Run these commands to diagnose issues:

```bash
# Check all environment details
make check-env

# Check Python specifically
make check-python

# Clean everything and start fresh
make clean-all
make setup-env
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS
- **Recommended**: Install Python via Homebrew: `brew install python`
- **Note**: System Python might be outdated
- **M1/M2 Macs**: All dependencies support Apple Silicon

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```

#### Windows
- Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- Enable "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Use Git Bash or PowerShell for make commands

### Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Python version**: `make check-python`
2. **Fix build dependencies**: `make fix-build-deps` (especially for macOS)
3. **Check environment**: `make check-env`  
4. **View detailed errors**: Look at the full error message
5. **Clean and retry**: `make clean-all && make setup-env`
6. **Manual setup**: Follow alternative setup instructions above

### Quick Resolution for Common Error

If you see the exact error from your screenshot:
```
Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... error
× Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully.
Did not find pkg-config by name 'pkg-config'
```

**Run these commands:**
```bash
# 1. Fix build dependencies
make fix-build-deps

# 2. Clean and retry
make clean-all
make setup-env
```

This will automatically install the missing build tools and retry the setup with compatible package versions.
